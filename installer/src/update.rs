//! `mikan update`: to the latest release, or to an image the admin names, with a backup
//! first. A panel already on PostgreSQL goes back to its previous image when the new one
//! cannot migrate the database, or does not start on an unchanged schema; otherwise it
//! stays stopped with its data preserved. Nodes always go back. The daily timer, the
//! panel's Update button and the admin's shell all come through here, one at a time
//! (lock.rs).
//!
//! The panel and this command talk through data/panel/update, which the panel owns, so
//! everything read from there is small, plain-file data and everything written goes through
//! panelfs (no link followed, no directory trusted):
//!
//!   update/policy.json  the panel: {"auto": true} when automatic updates are on, and
//!                       "channel": "beta" when it takes pre-releases (only these exact
//!                       words count; anything else is stable)
//!   update/request      the panel: its Update button (a path unit starts `update --requested`)
//!   update/status.json  this: {"state": "running" | "ok" | "failed", "version", "from", "error", "at"}
//!
//! A node talks the same way through data/node/update, which its container owns, with
//! one difference: there is no policy (its .env says), and the request names the release,
//! {"version": "X"}, which the panel asked its node API for. The panel's own version is
//! what it asks, but the node's container is not trusted any more than the panel's: the
//! version is only a name, and the node goes to the signed release of that version in the
//! release index of its channel, never to an image or an address from the request. It
//! never goes back, and never past the version asked for (hop by hop, when that release
//! cannot be reached at once). The daily timer on a node does nothing unless its root-owned
//! .env says MIKAN_AUTO_UPDATE=1: nodes follow their panel.
